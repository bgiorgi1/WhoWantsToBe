# Proposal of Game

I plan on creating a trivia game that is based on the game-show who wants to be a millionare, named "who wants to be a programmer"

# How to play the game

This is a two player game. Players take turn answering questions.  If you get the answer right on your turn you get 10points, if you don't get it right, then your oppenent has the ability to steal the question. 

# How it works
a serioes of computer based questions are randomly asked via the API https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=20&category=18&difficulty=easy&type=multiple
source: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

When you recieve points, it is reflected in your total score, shown at the top of the screen.

# How to win
The person with the most points at the end of the 20 questions asked wins the game.
