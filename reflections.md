1. watched a bunch of videos to try and make more sense of what we've been learning.  Researched a bunch on how I want my project 1 by watching some youtube videos that walked through the code.  Decided on a trivia based game and outlined goals for project. found an API i want to use to fetch the questions/answers
2. Goals for today is to minimize frustration and discouragement by staying positive in the unknown. At the very least I would like to have some functonality in the game by EOD. 
3. No blockers I can think of as yet, we'll see when we get going...
